# service-dataretrieval
Java Spring service which does use a virtuoso database and an RML Mapper to transform and link data to RDF

This is an old service which is deprecated. It was intended to trigger RDF mapping of a dataset and then put the RDF into a pipeline with quality measurement and entity linking.

Was replaced by TIBs pipeline and the maturity measurement pipeline.
